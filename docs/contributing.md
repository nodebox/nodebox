# Contributing

## Before You Start

- Confirm the build passes locally (`ant test`).
- For UI changes, run E2E where possible (`NODEBOX_E2E=1 ant test-e2e`).

## Code Style

- Match existing file formatting and naming conventions.
- Prefer localized changes and avoid large unrelated refactors.

## Pull Requests

- Describe the user-visible change.
- List test commands run (and results).
- Include screenshots or recordings for UI changes.

## Related Guidelines

- See `AGENTS.md` for repository-specific contributor notes.
